# Personal OS — Project Roadmap & Mind Map

> Single source of truth for project direction. Verify GitHub/Supabase/CI before making claims.
> Last reconciled: 2026-10-16.

## Current position

**Completed:** Core productivity, Recurring Tasks V1, Reminders V1, and Progress & Streaks V1.

**In progress:** Organization V1 — implementation is in PR #11; live database migrations, final-head CI, and authenticated end-to-end verification remain pending.

## Execution order

1. Recurring Tasks V1 — DONE
2. Reminders V1 — DONE
3. Progress & Streaks V1 — DONE
4. **Organization V1 — IN PROGRESS (PR #11; database rollout pending)**
5. Analytics V1
6. AI Assistant V1
7. Research Agent V1
8. Adaptive Scheduling
9. Production hardening

## Definition of done — every feature

1. Data model/schema
2. Authorization/RLS
3. Backend/application logic
4. Edge cases/failure states
5. Unit/integration/regression tests
6. UI/UX
7. CI/build
8. Migration/recovery implications
9. Documentation + `PROJECT_STATE.md`

## Quality rules

- PostgreSQL/Supabase is the source of truth for persisted data.
- Never invent schema or authorization behavior.
- Preserve activity history for future analytics/adaptive scheduling.
- AI uses validated application tools rather than direct database writes.
- Merge only after CI is green.
- Security/performance findings are fixed or explicitly tracked.
- Project state must be reconciled after each milestone.

## Current engineering priorities

### P0 — Product correctness
- Keep `main` green.
- Verify authentication and owner isolation.
- Maintain regression coverage for task, recurrence, reminder and progress flows.

### P1 — Organization V1
- Add a minimal project model.
- Add task → project association with owner-scoped RLS.
- Add subtasks/checklists without breaking existing task behavior.
- Add tests and dashboard/task UI incrementally.

### P2 — Production hardening
- Review foreign-key indexes and query performance.
- Complete timezone/DST semantics for reminders when scheduling requirements are defined.
- Add observability and recovery documentation.

## Branch map

- `main` — stable integrated product.
- Historical feature branches remain for traceability; do not treat them as current work unless GitHub confirms an active PR.

## Decision log

- 2026-08-30: Established persistent project-state hierarchy and mind tree.
- 2026-08-30: Scheduler/calendar integrated.
- 2026-08-30: Progress/streaks designed as a generic system rather than book-specific logic.
- 2026-09-05: Recurring Tasks V1, Reminders V1 and Progress & Streaks V1 verified as merged.
- 2026-09-05: Security issue #6 remediated and closed; security verification reported 0 lints.
- 2026-09-05: Organization V1 promoted to the next roadmap milestone.


## Current checkpoint — 2026-10-16

- Organization V1 implementation is under review in PR #11 (`feature/organization-v1`), not yet merged.
- GitHub Actions run #93 passed `npm install`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` on final verified commit `105c7b313d11ec5a0fbd0e0884d4df2b12ce793f` (https://github.com/mohith-krishnaa/personal-os/actions/runs/38873609164). Organization RLS policies use `(select auth.uid())`; the compatibility migration conditionally indexes legacy `projects.goal_id` when present. Live database rollout and authenticated end-to-end CRUD/isolation checks remain pending.
- Live database access is restored for the intended Supabase project `gujzvkyytxsnervovvrt` (`puttamohithkrishnaa@gmail.com's Project`, ACTIVE_HEALTHY). The live ledger does not yet include Organization V1 migrations; `projects` has legacy `title` and supports `COMPLETED` status.
- Next steps: finish migration review; plan a safe rollout with recovery checks; apply/verify migrations only after preflight; run Supabase security/performance advisors; then exercise authenticated owner-isolation and CRUD flows. Do not mark Organization V1 complete until these checks pass.
- Scope after Organization V1: Analytics V1, AI Assistant V1, Research Agent V1, Adaptive Scheduling, and production hardening. Each milestone needs schema/RLS, application logic, edge-case tests, UI, CI, and recovery documentation.
